# CrossRaise
CrossRaise is an online platform where people can raise funds for their projects, startups, causes, or initiatives using different types of digital money, like Bitcoin or Ethereum. It's like a digital version of asking friends and family for support; instead, you're asking anyone in the world who believes in your cause.
